I am a Software Engineer working in the
[Rackspace Private Cloud](http://www.rackspace.co.uk/cloud/private)
product development team. My days are usually spent developing
[Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/)-based automation for the
deployment of [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/) in production
environments. This has resulted in contributions to
[OpenStack-Ansible](http://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible)
and other OpenStack projects. In a previous life I was an architect
and operator for an OpenStack Public Cloud in South Africa which was
automated through [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/).
